                <p class="color">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong>-
                    <br> another important game guideline.

                        <h1>Youtubability</h1><br>
                        <p>A key driver of youtubability is the clarity of your gameplay to a potential
                            player.</p>
                        <p>
                            Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting the
                            lowest possible CPIs for your games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is evident, for example,
                            can she tell which character she controls? Is the objective clear? Does it look fun to play? Has she understood
                            the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).
                        </p>
                        <p>Make sure to use colours to help
                            indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are clearly contrasted
                            (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

                        If you want to run user tests with  friends and family or even random people in the street, it
                        is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to
                        understand their expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make it obvious with visual elements that help understand the objective and controls of the
                        game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space
                        dedicated to drawing.

                    <p class="color-1">People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their phone’s
                        Facebook feed,
                        everything will
                        seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. You should also
                        consider
                        whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a small screen. With an
                        average watch
                        time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator pitch!

                    <p class="color-1"> Think of the moment when you decide to click
                        on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
                        for
                        your game videos.
